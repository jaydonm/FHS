For Humanitys Sake is run by President Adriana Dosantos with the help of Treasurer Dina Dosantos.  For Humanity Sake  wants to provide education and nutritional resources to needy students and their families, in Cape Verde, S達o Nicolau.  We believe the sustainable impact starts by creating a better future for the disadvantaged, that's why we are an organization dedicated to advancing the personal development of the children in S達o Nicolau with access to education. We believe that education is the foundation to building a happy and healthy life, and so the big portion of our work is to facilitate greater access to educational opportunity and resources for the people of S達o Nicolau.
