<p class="desc">For Humanity's sake was founded in July of 2020. It was started in the memory of Maggie Medina. Heres a direct quote from Adrianna for why they started FHS.â€œOur family left the Cabo Verde Islands in 1969 our first trip back was in 2018, Maggie, saw a need, to help those in need in Cabo Verde, She planned to retire in August 2020 and dedicate her time to raising funds to carry her mission. Unfortunately Maggie passed away unexpectedly in February 2020 leaving her wishes unfulfilled. In July of 2020 Dina and I decided to fulfill Maggie dream. This has been a bittersweet adventure for us and we hope to continue this with your help."
